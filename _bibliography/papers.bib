  abstract = {We reformulate quantum computation in terms of Lagrangian (sum-over-path) formalism, in contrast to the widely used Hamiltonian (unitary gate) formulation. We exemplify this formalism with some widely-studied models, including the standard quantum circuit model, quantum optimization heuristics, and quantum random walks. The meanings of Lagrangian (action) are interpreted in various contexts of quantum computation, such as complexity analysis. Furthermore, an analog quantum simulation scheme is suggested where the Lagrangian serves as the starting point and the sum-over-path method is applied.},

  abstract = {The general formulation of a determinate solution problem is deduced for the transverse vibrations of a thin loaded rod. The vibration frequencies of a thin homogeneous rod carrying a concentrated mass as a function of the load's position and mass are exactly solved. The dynamic measurement method of Young's modulus of the rods is presented within this theory. Our measurements of Young's modulus in the dynamic method agree with those in the traditional bending method, therefore the theory is verified by our experiments.},
